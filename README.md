Windows Tweaks
==============
A small collection of useful scripts for optimizing, cleaning, and tweaking the Windows OS (XP and newer).

**This repo is designed for inexperience users**. I will not be including unsafe or "dangerous" tweaks that may negitively effect the average user. Even with that said, it is still advised to **proceed with caution** -- I am not perfect; mistakes can happen.

To help users understand what is being done, informative ouput will be logged to the console and explained in more detail below. Knowledge is power when it comes to your PC.
